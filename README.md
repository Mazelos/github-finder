# Github Finder

Mobile application you can use to find Github users and get their infos.

I built this with Expo and React Native in managed workflow.

</br></br>



### Install the project 

Clone the repo and install all the dependencies (Expo must be installed globally).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Mazelos/github-finder.git my-project
cd my-project
yarn install
```

</br>



### Start the project 

- Start the project with the Cli tool.

  ```shell
  yarn start
  ```

  in this case we can use a physical device connecting it via Expo app with the Qr code or you can run it on the Ios simulator and Android emulator typing `i` or `a` in the terminal (type `h` for more info).

- Start directly in the desidered emulator

  ```shell
  yarn run android
  yarn run ios
  ```
